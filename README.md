Google's App Exploratory Data Analysis

A look into Google's Playstore, and breaking the data down into sections.  I love Python's libraries, because at an analytical standpoint, there's not much you cannot do.  Definitely check it out, very fun and meaningful project for me, thanks to the ones who helped when I hit a bump and mostly to Google.  More to come soon.
